# 🎾 Move IT (WIP)

This project is from Next Level Week by Rocketseat. It consists of a pomodoro style timer that suggests exercises for the dev to do on the breaks, with a game like leveling system to bring extra motivation to users.

This was made as a way to study React's Context API and Next.js.
